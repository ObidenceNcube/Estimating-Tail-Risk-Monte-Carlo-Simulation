Monte-Carlo Simulation


The expected return is a measure of the average return that an investment is expected to generate over a period of time. In this case, the expected return is 0.0008367575959988834.

The volatility is a measure of the risk associated with an investment. It represents the degree of variation in the returns of an investment over time. In this case, the volatility is 0.0004277701826706375.

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It is calculated by dividing the excess return of an investment (the difference between the expected return and the risk-free rate) by its standard deviation (a measure of volatility). A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that an investment has generated higher returns per unit of risk. In this case, the Sharpe ratio is 1.9560914479239113.
